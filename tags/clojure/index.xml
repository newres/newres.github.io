      <description>This article is the third part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, with examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. In part one the basic elements of &amp;ldquo;The Fox and the Stork&amp;rdquo; story were formalised as Linked Data in Clojure, while in part two we investigated how various literal values can be described. In this article we examine how information about facts themselves, such as meta-information, can be described with Linked Data.</description>

      <description>This article is the second part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, with examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. Part one can be found on this site where the basic elements of the Fox and the Stork story were formalised. In this article we examine how literal values can be represented, using Clojure, in Linked Data. The code to enable the functionality described in these articles can be found in the Aesopica library for using Clojure to write Linked Data.</description>

      <description>Spider-Man is one of the most iconic heroes of the Marvel universe.

One of the biggest draws of Spider-Man that although he is a superhero and fought various villains from cosmic beings to petty criminals, he also had to deal with regular everyday problems, such as money issues, school life and the pressure of a job.</description>

Programming is also an art, as described in the article by Donald Knuth titled Computer Programming as an Art and in certain aspects of programming languages can be seen as art styles.</description>
