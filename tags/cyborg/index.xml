      <description>Human beings enhanced by machine parts, often called cyborgs, are a staple of the science-fiction and comic books. The, very aptly named, hero Cyborg, is a good example of this. Due to advanced mechanical modifications he not only has greatly increased strength and the ability to fly, but he is able to interface directly with computer systems to organize and plan ahead. These skills make him an important member of many superhero teams such as the Justice League and Teen Titans.</description>
