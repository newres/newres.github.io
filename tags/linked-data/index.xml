      <description>This article is the fourth part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, with examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. The topic of this article is to describe how to do some basic conversions from our Clojure representation of Linked Data, to some of the other formats, such as Turtle, NQUADS or JSON-LD.
In previous articles of this series, we created a Clojure based syntax for defining Linked Data.</description>

      <description>This article is the third part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, with examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. In part one the basic elements of &amp;ldquo;The Fox and the Stork&amp;rdquo; story were formalised as Linked Data in Clojure, while in part two we investigated how various literal values can be described. In this article we examine how information about facts themselves, such as meta-information, can be described with Linked Data.</description>

      <description>This article is the second part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, with examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. Part one can be found on this site where the basic elements of the Fox and the Stork story were formalised. In this article we examine how literal values can be represented, using Clojure, in Linked Data. The code to enable the functionality described in these articles can be found in the Aesopica library for using Clojure to write Linked Data.</description>

      <description>The stories called Aesop&amp;rsquo;s Fables or the Aesopica, are an ancient collection of stories that have been passed down to modern day.

One of such stories is the tale of the Fox and the Stork. There are many versions of this fable, but the overall outline is generally as follows:</description>

      <description>This article contains some very minor spoilers for the Blade Runner 2049 movie. If you have not seen it yet, by all means do, it is really good.
