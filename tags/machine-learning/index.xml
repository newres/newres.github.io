      <description>Deep Learning is a field within Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has got quite a lot of attention lately, due to some truly impressive results in recent years. From recognizing objects in images with accuracy that rivals humans, to generating realistic looking texts, to even beating professional players in Starcraft 2, some truly groundbreaking applications are done with Deep Learning techniques.
As someone whose AI background is more Symbolic Artifical Intelligence, but is anxious to learn, it is a good time as any to explore this field.</description>
