      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article contains some very minor spoilers for the Blade Runner 2049 movie. If you have not seen it yet, by all means do, it is really good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And blood-black nothingness began to spin&amp;hellip; A system of cells interlinked within cells interlinked within cells interlinked within one stem&amp;hellip; And dreadfully distinct against the dark, a tall white fountain played.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The above is a quote from the poem &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire&lt;/em&gt;. It occurs in the novel titled &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire&lt;/em&gt; by Vladimir Nabokov which has been recently used in the movie &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;. In the movie it was part of the Baseline test, a way to test the emotional response of a Replicant. The reason they undergo this process is because their creators fear that the connections they might make in their lives would give them emotions that would interfere with their intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In life, such relationships always surround us. They are not just between people, but in our work, in our beliefs, in our art and in the knowledge we represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we intend to describe the link between the movie &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and the book &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire&lt;/em&gt;. We can summarize this information with a number of facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;Blade Runner is a movie. 
Blade Runner has a character named K.
K is a Replicant.
Replicants must pass a Baseline Test.
Baseline Test is based on the poem Pale Fire.
Pale Fire is written by Vladimir Nabokov.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above facts show that the links that can tie together various pieces of knowledge. One can trace the connections from a simple description of a movie, released in 2017, to the author Vladimir Nabokov, as was intended by the writers of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the above recitation of facts is easy to follow, from a knowledge representation perspective one can find some issues with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the description is imprecise. As the &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; could refer to the newer &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; movie as opposed to the 1982 original titled &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Second the set of facts is incomplete. The poem &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire&lt;/em&gt; is indeed written by Vladimir Nabokov, but it is presented in the book &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire&lt;/em&gt;, also written by Nabokov as the work of the fictional poet &lt;em&gt;John Shade&lt;/em&gt;. The set of facts here fails to make the explicit distinction between &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire (poem)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire (book)&lt;/em&gt;, and that the poem is contained in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps most importantly, the above list of facts relies a lot on the users grasp of the English natural language. For a program, it can be surprisingly difficult to understand the relationships such as &amp;ldquo;is a&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;is based on&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;named&amp;rdquo;, etc between the various elements in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues seem somewhat nit-picky, as this information can be derived from the rest of the article. However this means that the knowledge in the summary does not stand on its own. If those facts are detailed without the rest of the article, or if the reader of them is a machine, and not a person that can easily add some context, they might lead them to incorrect or insufficient conclusions. They might get wrong information that the 1982 movie Blade Runner has a character named K, or fail to see the link that poem is contained in the book by the same author. And although in the case of Blade Runner, these issues might seem small, this is different if the knowledge relates to financial, legal or clinical domains. Here, mistakes or omissions can be costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a larger list of more detailed facts can help with these issues, but to a certain extent they still remain due to the ambiguity of the natural language. In addition the fact that is often very easy to skip over implicit details. This is especially true for the issue of a computer not being able to make (enough) sense of this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposed solution to these issues is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linked Data&lt;/a&gt; and in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf#w3c_all&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Resource Description Framework (RDF)&lt;/a&gt;, with which Linked Data data can be expressed. These technologies allow us to represent the above facts in a more formal and precise way, that can make it both human and machine read- and write-able.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/img/post/interlinked-data/rdf.png&#34; alt=&#34;Logo of RDF © W3C&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Resource Description Framework&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Logo of RDF © W3C
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the significant feature of RDF is that requires precise naming. Many elements of are either a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Resource_Identifier&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;International Resource Identifier (IRI)&lt;/a&gt; or some raw data-types. A good example of the former are URLs such as the link to this website: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newresalhaider.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.newresalhaider.com&lt;/a&gt; , that allows one to find a web resource. Examples of the later, are texts or numbers, such as &amp;ldquo;Blade Runner&amp;rdquo; or 15 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other significant feature of RDF is that most knowledge is represented as a set of facts, where each fact is expressed as subject, predicate object triples. For example the fact &amp;ldquo;Blade Runner is a movie&amp;rdquo; is expressed with the subject &amp;ldquo;Blade Runner&amp;rdquo; the predicate &amp;ldquo;is a&amp;rdquo; and the object &amp;ldquo;movie&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting this together in RDF (using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Turtle&lt;/a&gt; notation) you would get a triple such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Turtle&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;http://www.newresalhaider.com/ontologies/bladerunner/blade-runner&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://www.newresalhaider.com/ontologies/bladerunner/movie&amp;gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example is an RDF way of saying &amp;ldquo;Blade Runner is a type of movie&amp;rdquo; or alternatively &amp;ldquo;Blade runner is a movie&amp;rdquo;. This type of representation shows us a couple of benefits. First we are now being more precise as each element in the triple can refer to one specific resource, for example Blade Runner or Movie, where there IRI makes sure we do not necessarily confuse the term with anything else. Second this also shows off the fact that you can link to resources from different places: the predicate &amp;ldquo;type&amp;rdquo; is from a completely different domain. This allows us to re-use knowledge that has already been defined. As one can expect saying something is of a &amp;ldquo;type&amp;rdquo;, for example an apple is a type of a fruit, is actually very common. This is one of the main strengths of what makes Linked Data so powerful, one can re-use knowledge already stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typing out the full IRI each time can be pretty bothersome, and it does not help the readability either. Thankfully we can define a common prefix we use separately, and just write the last part of the IRI in each case. In this case we define a base prefix and we refer to subject and object by &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;#movie&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Turtle&#34;&gt;@base &amp;lt;http://www.newresalhaider.com/ontologies/bladerunner&amp;gt; .
&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#movie&amp;gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do similar things when linking elements that have been already defined elsewhere. In this case we define a prefix to use as an abbreviation while writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Turtle&#34;&gt;@base &amp;lt;http://www.newresalhaider.com/ontologies/bladerunner&amp;gt; .
@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .

&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt; rdf:type &amp;lt;#movie&amp;gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, &amp;ldquo;rdf:type&amp;rdquo; as a predicate is so common that there is an even simpler notation. We can use &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; as a predicate, which is in line with what we intend to express: &amp;ldquo;Blade Runner is a movie&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting RDF facts look as follows (note that the rdf prefix could be omitted here as the &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; abbreviation does not make it necessary):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Turtle&#34;&gt;@base &amp;lt;http://www.newresalhaider.com/ontologies/bladerunner&amp;gt; .
@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .

&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt; a &amp;lt;#movie&amp;gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we aim to write something that is just a text as a subject, say when referring to the title of a movie , we can do that as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Turtle&#34;&gt;@base &amp;lt;http://www.newresalhaider.com/ontologies/bladerunner&amp;gt; .
@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .

&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt; a &amp;lt;#movie&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#title&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Blade Runner 2049&amp;quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this way of writing, we can actually rewrite our original set of facts as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Turtle&#34;&gt;@base &amp;lt;http://www.newresalhaider.com/ontologies/bladerunner&amp;gt; .
@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .
@prefix foaf: &amp;lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&amp;gt; .

&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt; a &amp;lt;#movie&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#title&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Blade Runner 2049&amp;quot;.
&amp;lt;#blade-runner&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#has-character&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#K&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;#K&amp;gt; foaf:name &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;.
&amp;lt;#K&amp;gt; a &amp;lt;#replicant&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;#replicant&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#must-pass&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#baseline-test&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;#baseline-test&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#based-on&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#pale-fire-poem&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;#pale-fire-poem&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#included-in&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#pale-fire-book&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;#pale-fire-book&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#written-by&amp;gt; &amp;lt;#nabokov&amp;gt;.
&amp;lt;#nabokov&amp;gt; foaf:name &amp;quot;Vladimir Nabokov&amp;quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this version we suddenly defined our list of facts in a more formal manner than previously. This makes it much more simpler for machines to understand this set of facts. In fact we actually used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_(ontology)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Friend of a Friend (FOAF) ontology&lt;/a&gt; to use the notion of name that is also used when talking about relationships between people. In fact, one could argue that using an existing movie dataset, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://old.datahub.io/dataset/linkedmdb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linked Movie Database&lt;/a&gt; would have been even better, which we will leave as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I could show a glimpse of the possibilities the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Semantic Web&lt;/a&gt; for which Linked Data forms the basis, with this example. Of course the above is just scratching the surface of what it can be done with RDF, Linked Data. With each addition, our set of facts could grow. One could go beyond a single movie and build a document of poems that are references in movies, or a knowledge base of the Blade Runner franchise. It might be easier than one expects, due to the fact that knowledge, much like people are&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interlinked.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Trouble with Triples</title>
      <link>/post/trouble-with-triples/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Star Trek episode &amp;ldquo;The Trouble with Tribbles&amp;rdquo; the crew of the starship Enterprise encounters creatures called Tribbles. They are cute, simple creatures of mysterious origin that seem harmless at first but when they multiply the pose a big problem for the ship and the crew.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/img/post/trouble-with-triples/tribbles.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tribbles © 1967 Paramount Pictures&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Representing and reasoning with knowledge have surprisingly similar problems. A single fact on its own is a relatively straightforward affair. A fact, such as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tribbles are cute&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; can be represented with only three parts of a triple: a subject &lt;strong&gt;Tribbles&lt;/strong&gt;, a predicate &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; and an object &lt;strong&gt;cute&lt;/strong&gt;. Things can get quite a bit more difficult when there are more facts/triples: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tribbles are round&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tribbles are furry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tribbles originate from Iota Geminorum IV&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, and other millions of facts that one could have about such a species. This is especially true when one takes into the account that the fact that knowledge can be interlinked &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Iota Geminorum IV is a planet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Iota Geminorum IV is also known as Fafniri&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Iota Geminorum IV is also known as Tribble Prime&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes representing and reasoning with facts a non-trivial process. A system that holds all this knowledge should be able to answer a query such as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do Tribbles originate from Fafniri?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; with a yes, based on the facts &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tribbles originate from Iota Geminorum IV&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Iota Geminorum IV is a planet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Iota Geminorum IV is also known as Fafniri&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, even in the context of millions of other triples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting issue with representing facts is the context of the information. To us the viewers, and initially to the crew of the Enterprise, Tribbles look like harmless and adorable creatures. To the Klingons they are an ecological menace and their mortal enemies. How such &amp;ldquo;knowledge about knowledge&amp;rdquo; is represented and used is often a challenging problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various technologies have been proposed to deal with the above-mentioned issues. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Semantic Web technologies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linked Data&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/owl#w3c_all&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ontologies&lt;/a&gt; in particular have been designed around solving many of these problems. Nonetheless there is room for improvement. In the future I hope to be able to explain how these techniques can be utilized and perhaps lessen the pain points that currently surround (the use of) them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legal Regulatory Compliance Within The Financial Domain.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regulatory compliance is the goal of an organization to ensure it complies with all the relevant policies, regulations and laws. Failure to comply can have grave consequences for an organization, with huge fines and penalties being imposed. Regulatory pressure has been increasing over the years, with new and more complex regulation being enacted. This is especially true for the financial sector, where in the wake of the financial crisis, new policies and laws where enacted, both internal and external, to prevent a similar crisis happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new and changing policies and laws give a huge challenge for financial organizations. These issues get compounded by fact that in a global world, internal, national and international regulations create an interwoven set of rules that need to be interpreted and applied on various financial products and services. Ensuring this compliance, is a time and expertise intensive task that often needs to be done manually. Automating these tasks is a huge challenge due to the fact that more traditional techniques are often ill equipped to tackle such an ever changing and complex domain in a way that is transparent to the domain experts and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, the goal is to find innovative techniques and solutions to the issue of regulatory compliance in the legal and financial domain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The time of clinical health professionals is incredibly valuable. Software can alleviate the burden of physicians, nursers and other health experts and allow them to provide better, more effective health care to patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating, maintaining and using software in clinical environments is a difficult process. Not only it is paramount that such software needs to be correct, it has to have an understanding of highly domain specific knowledge about clinical processes in order to provide beneficial support to health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic Web technologies, in particular anthologies enable better clinical software. Ontologies allow for a formal and explicit way to model knowledge that is understandable for both clinicians and machines alike.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software bugs and errors have a monumental negative impact on society. Not only can they have huge monetary cost, ranging into billions of dollars annually in the United States alone, but in some cases can even lead to disasters that lead to the loss of life. Preventing such issues from happening requires a large amount of effort in designing and maintaining software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However designing and maintaining error free software remains a difficult problem. Not only is software getting more complex, its correct functioning often depends on highly specific domain knowledge of its purpose and its environment. Therefor manually checking the correctness of the software is expensive in both time and available expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential solution that was proposed for this is using machine understandable domain knowledge to help automate software maintenance tasks. Formal ontologies have been proposed and used in various fields to make domain knowledge explicit and usable for both humans and software. In particular during my thesis work, titled &amp;ldquo;An Ontology Based Framework for Specification Mining and Dynamic Program Analysis&amp;rdquo;, the use of ontologies to help understand the working of a running program were successfully explored. In particular it was shown that for a category of bugs, general ontologies such as WordNet, can be used find issues issues from program traces.&lt;/p&gt;
