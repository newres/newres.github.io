      <description>Meditations are a series of notes that the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote for guidance and self-improvement. While it is likely that the emperor wrote them purely for his own benefit, they have been published after his death and contain elements of Stoic philosophy that many people have consulted since.
One way achieve a bit of self-improvement, coding-wise, is to pick a small project to do with a new set of tools.</description>

      <description>One of the most well-known and popular online multi-player games is League of Legends. In this game two teams of five players compete against other. Within the game each player controls a champion that they can use to defeat the enemy team by destroying their base. There are many aspects required to winning a game of League of Legends: good in-game strategy, good control of champions but also selecting a good composition of 5 champions, out of more than a hundred, that fits the needs of the players and play-styles.</description>

      <description>Human beings enhanced by machine parts, often called cyborgs, are a staple of the science-fiction and comic books. The, very aptly named, hero Cyborg, is a good example of this. Due to advanced mechanical modifications he not only has greatly increased strength and the ability to fly, but he is able to interface directly with computer systems to organize and plan ahead. These skills make him an important member of many superhero teams such as the Justice League and Teen Titans.</description>

      <description>One of the greatest Star Trek episodes is titled Darmok in Star Trek: The Next Generation. It has the hallmarks of a great Star Trek: TNG episode: a first contact between two civilizations and a dilemma that is not solved by violence but by thinking and understanding.
One of the nicest logic programming languages is miniKanren. This is due to the fact that it is a small, relatively easy to understand Logic Programming (LP) language and has implementations in many programming languages.</description>

      <description>This article is the fifth part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, using examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. The topic of this article is to explain the somewhat contentious subject of blank nodes.
One of the strengths of RDF as a graph representation format is the way resources are named. Through the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) every element of the graph can be uniquely identified.</description>

      <description>Deep Learning is a field within Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has got quite a lot of attention lately, due to some truly impressive results in recent years. From recognizing objects in images with accuracy that rivals humans, to generating realistic looking texts, to even beating professional players in Starcraft 2, some truly groundbreaking applications are done with Deep Learning techniques.
As someone whose AI background is more Symbolic Artifical Intelligence, but is anxious to learn, it is a good time as any to explore this field.</description>

      <description>The use of logic is a common element in Science Fiction. In the Star Trek universe Vulcans are a species that is famously known for aiming to live by logic and reason. Because of this they are often considered masters of these subjects. Yet there was a case in an episode of the Star Trek show Deep Space 9, where Quark, a Ferengi, was able to convince Sakonna, a Vulcan, of the error of her logic and reasoning.</description>

      <description>This article is the fourth part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, with examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. The topic of this article is to describe how to do some basic conversions from our Clojure representation of Linked Data, to some of the other formats, such as Turtle, NQUADS or JSON-LD.
In previous articles of this series, we created a Clojure based syntax for defining Linked Data.</description>

      <description>This article is the third part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, with examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. In part one the basic elements of &amp;ldquo;The Fox and the Stork&amp;rdquo; story were formalised as Linked Data in Clojure, while in part two we investigated how various literal values can be described. In this article we examine how information about facts themselves, such as meta-information, can be described with Linked Data.</description>

      <description>This article is the second part of a series, examining the use of the Clojure language for representing Linked Data, with examples from Aesop&amp;rsquo;s stories. Part one can be found on this site where the basic elements of the Fox and the Stork story were formalised. In this article we examine how literal values can be represented, using Clojure, in Linked Data. The code to enable the functionality described in these articles can be found in the Aesopica library for using Clojure to write Linked Data.</description>

      <description>The stories called Aesop&amp;rsquo;s Fables or the Aesopica, are an ancient collection of stories that have been passed down to modern day. These stories are of diverse origins they cover a wide variety of themes. Although originally intended for an adult audience, in later times were often used for the education of children.
One of such stories is the tale of the Fox and the Stork. There are many versions of this fable, but the overall outline is generally as follows:</description>

Although the history of software development is much shorter than the history of mankind, there already exists artifacts that have near mythological status when it comes to software development, yet often go hidden underneath the surface.</description>

      <description>Spider-Man is one of the most iconic heroes of the Marvel universe. Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Spider-Man is a regular teenager named Peter Parker, who due to being bitten by a radio-active spider, gains abilities such as the proportional strength of a spider, wall crawling and a spider sense to detect upcoming danger. One of the biggest draws of Spider-Man that although he is a superhero and fought various villains from cosmic beings to petty criminals, he also had to deal with regular everyday problems, such as money issues, school life and the pressure of a job.</description>

      <description>Programmers, like professionals in other fields, are passionate about their tools. One of the main elements in the toolbox of coders are programming languages. They allow their users to express solutions through code to tackle a large variety of problems in many domains.
Programming is also an art, as described in the article by Donald Knuth titled Computer Programming as an Art and in certain aspects of programming languages can be seen as art styles.</description>

      <description>In the Star Trek episode &amp;ldquo;The Trouble with Tribbles&amp;rdquo; the crew of the starship Enterprise encounters creatures called Tribbles. They are cute, simple creatures of mysterious origin that seem harmless at first but when they multiply the pose a big problem for the ship and the crew.
